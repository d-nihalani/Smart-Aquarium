# Smart Aquarium

## Description
Smart Aquarium is an IoT-based project that automates the monitoring and maintenance of an aquarium. The system includes a microcontroller unit that collects data from sensors and controls various components of the aquarium, such as a water pump, level-indicator, and a feeder. The system can also be controlled and monitored remotely through a mobile app.

## Components
- ESP32 MicroController
- LM35 temperature sensor
- SG90 Servo Motor
- 4 Channel Relay module
- 3-6V Water pump
- 5V power adapter
- Custom Water Level Indicator



## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature and water level inside the aquarium
- Automatic control of water pump and bubbler to maintain optimum water conditions
- Programmable feeding for customizing the aquatic's food
- BLynk Mobile/Web app for remote monitoring and control

## Getting Started
To build and deploy the project, follow these steps:
1. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram
2. Upload the sketch to the Arduino IDE
3. Install the Blynk mobile app on your smartphone and connect to a WiFi network
4. Monitor and control your aquarium from anywhere

## Future Scope
- Adding a pH sensor, Dissolved Oxygen Sensor, TDS sensor for monitoring water quality.
- Integration with voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home
- Adding a camera for real-time streaming of the aquarium
